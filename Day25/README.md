## Day 25: Running Time and Complexity

**Task**:

A prime is a natural number greater than `1` that has no positive divisors other than `1` and itself. Given a number,
`n`, determine and print whether it's `Prime` or `Not prime`.

**Note**: If possible, try to come up with a `O(sqrt(n))` primality algorithm, or see what sort of optimizations you 
come up with for an `O(n)` algorithm. Be sure to check out the Editorial after submitting your code!

**Input Format**

The first line contains an integer, `T`, the number of test cases.
Each of the `T` subsequent lines contains an integer, `n`, to be tested for primality.

**Constrains**

* `1 <= T <= 30`
* `1 <= n <= 2 * pow(10, 9)`

**Output Format**

For each test case, print whether `n` is `Prime` or `Not prime` on a new line.

**Sample Input**

```
3
12
5
7
```

**Sample Output**

```
Not prime
Prime
Prime
```

**Solution**:

In `running-time-and-complexity.py`.
