##Day 3: Intro to Conditional Statements

**Task**:

Given an integer, `n`, perform the following conditional actions:

* If `n` is odd, print `Weird`;
* If `n` is even and in the inclusive range of `2` to `5`, print `Not Weird`;
* If `n` is even and in the inclusive range of `6` to `20`, print `Weird`;
* If `n` is even and greater than `20`, print `Not Weird`.

Complete the stub code provided in your editor to print whether or not `n` is weird.

**Solution**:

In `if-statement.py`.
