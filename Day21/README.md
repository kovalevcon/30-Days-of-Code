# 30 Days of Code - Day 21

To view solutions, see the file `generics.java` in your text editor.

**Caution**: solutions for Python 3 not provided. Used Java 8 solution.

## Day 21: Generics

**Task**:

Write a single generic function named `printArray`; this function must take an array of generic elements as a parameter
(the exception to this is C++, which takes a vector). 
The locked Solution class in your editor tests your function.

**Note**: You must use generics to solve this challenge. Do not write overloaded functions. 

**Input Format**

The locked Solution class in your editor will pass different types of arrays to your `printArray` function.

**Constraints**

* You must have exactly `1` function named printArray.

**Output Format**

Your printArray function should print each element of its generic array parameter on a new line.

**Sample Input**

```
1
2
3
2
Hello
World
```

**Sample Output**

```
1
2
3
2
Hello
World
```

**Solution**:

In `generics.java`.
