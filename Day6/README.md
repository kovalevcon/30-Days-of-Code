## Day 6: Let's Review

**Task**:

Given a string,`S`, of length `N` that is indexed from `0` to `N-1`, print its even-indexed and odd-indexed
characters as `2` space-separated strings on a single line (see the Sample below for more detail).

**Note:** `0` is considered to be an even index. 

**Input Format**

The first line contains an integer, `T` (the number of test cases).
Each line `i` of the `T` subsequent lines contain a String, `S`. 

**Output Format**

For each String `Sj` (where `0 <= j <= T - 1`), print `Sj`'s even-indexed characters, followed by a space,
followed by `Sj`'s odd-indexed characters. 

**Sample Input**

```
2
Hacker
Rank
```

**Sample Output**

```
Hce akr
Rn ak
```

**Solution**:
