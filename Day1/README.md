# 30 Days of Code - Day 1

To view solutions, see the file `data-types.py` in your text editor.

## Day 1: Data Types

**Task**:

Complete the code in the editor below. The variables `i`, `d`, and `s` are already declared
and initialized for you. You must:

1. Declare `3` variables: one of type int, one of type double, and one of type String.

2. Read `3` lines of input from stdin (according to the sequence given in the Input Format section below) 
and initialize your `3` variables.

3. Use the `+` operator to perform the following operations:
    * Print the sum of `i` plus your int variable on a new line.
    * Print the sum of `d` plus your double variable to a scale of one decimal place on a new line.
    * Concatenate `s` with the string you read as input and print the result on a new line. 

**Solution**:

In `data-types.py`.
